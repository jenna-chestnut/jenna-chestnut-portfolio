<h4>Hi there! I'm Jenna and I'm a web developer (in the making) living in Nashville, Tennessee.</h4>

<h3>Jenna's Story</h3>

  <p>Since my first login, I've always had a penchant for navigating computer systems. The purposeful shift from restaurant industry to the medical field in 2017 gave me an opportunity to further explore my tech skills, and fulfill my drive to improve the lives of others. </p>
  
  <p>As the go-to person for error messages, website tweaks and needed fixes when IT isn't around, I know that I want to learn and accomplish much more. Now that I have signed up for the Thinkful Engineering Immersion program, I am taking important steps to making this goal a reality!</p>

  <p>Let's connect if you are looking for a study buddy, a mentee or a future web developer.</p>
